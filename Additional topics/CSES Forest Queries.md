#PrefixSum #precompute #Matrix 
Of course! This is a classic problem that is perfectly suited for the 2D Prefix Sum technique.

A naive solution would be to iterate over each rectangle for every query, which would be too slow (`O(q * n^2)`). By pre-calculating a 2D prefix sum array, we can answer each query in constant time (`O(1)`), making the overall solution very efficient.

The plan is:
1.  Read the grid of `.` and `*`.
2.  Create a 2D integer grid of the same size, where `*` is `1` and `.` is `0`.
3.  Build a 2D prefix sum array from this integer grid in `O(n^2)` time.
4.  For each of the `q` queries, use the prefix sum array to calculate the number of trees in the given rectangle in `O(1)` time.

The total time complexity will be `O(n^2 + q)`, which is well within the typical time limits.

### C++ Solution with Line-by-Line Explanation

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

// Use the standard namespace for cleaner code in contests.
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // ---- 1. SETUP AND FAST I/O ----
    // This is a standard competitive programming optimization.
    // ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) unties C++ streams from C streams.
    // cin.tie(NULL) prevents cin from flushing cout.
    // This makes input/output operations much faster, which is crucial for large inputs.
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);

    // ---- 2. INPUT & INITIALIZATION ----
    int n, q; // n: size of the grid, q: number of queries.
    cin >> n >> q; // Read n and q from the input.

    // We create a prefix sum array of size (n+1) x (n+1) to use 1-based indexing.
    // This simplifies the formulas and avoids out-of-bounds errors for coordinates like (i-1, j-1).
    // Initializing all values to 0 is important as it provides the base case for our calculations.
    // An 'int' is sufficient here since the maximum number of trees (1000*1000 = 1,000,000) fits.
    vector<vector<int>> prefix_sum(n + 1, vector<int>(n + 1, 0));

    // ---- 3. BUILDING THE PREFIX SUM ARRAY ----
    // Iterate from i=1 to n and j=1 to n, corresponding to the 1-based grid coordinates.
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; ++j) {
            char cell_char; // Variable to store the character for the current cell.
            cin >> cell_char; // Read the character ('.' or '*').

            // Convert the character to a numerical value. A tree '*' is 1, an empty square '.' is 0.
            int value = (cell_char == '*') ? 1 : 0;

            // This is the core formula to build the 2D prefix sum array.
            // It calculates the total number of trees in the rectangle from (1,1) to (i,j).
            prefix_sum[i][j] = value                         // The value (0 or 1) of the current cell.
                               + prefix_sum[i - 1][j] // Add the number of trees in the rectangle directly above.
                               + prefix_sum[i][j - 1]// Add the number of trees in                                              //the rectangle directly to the left.
                               - prefix_sum[i - 1][j - 1];   // The top-left region was counted twice, so we subtract it once.
        }
    }

    // ---- 4. PROCESSING QUERIES ----
    // Loop 'q' times to process all the queries.
    while (q--) {
        int y1, x1, y2, x2; // Coordinates of the query rectangle's top-left (y1, x1) and bottom-right (y2, x2) corners.
        cin >> y1 >> x1 >> y2 >> x2; // Read the four coordinate values for the current query.

        // This is the core formula to query the sum of a sub-rectangle in O(1) time.
        // It uses the precomputed values and the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
        int result = prefix_sum[y2][x2]                 // Total trees in the large rectangle from (1,1) to (y2,x2).
                     - prefix_sum[y1 - 1][x2]           // Subtract the unwanted trees in the rectangle above our target.
                     - prefix_sum[y2][x1 - 1]           // Subtract the unwanted trees in the rectangle to the left of our target.
                     + prefix_sum[y1 - 1][x1 - 1];      // Add back the top-left corner region's trees, as they were subtracted twice.

        // Print the final result for the current query. Using '\n' is faster than 'endl' in competitive programming.
        cout << result << "\n";
    }

    // ---- 5. END OF PROGRAM ----
    // A return value of 0 indicates that the program executed successfully.
    return 0;
}
```

### How the Code Works for the "Forest Queries" Problem:

1.  **Input Reading:** The code first reads the grid dimensions `n` and the number of queries `q`.
2.  **Prefix Sum Array (`prefix_sum`)**:
    *   It's a `(n+1) x (n+1)` grid. The extra row and column are all zeroes, which elegantly handles the boundary conditions. For instance, when you query a rectangle starting at row 1, `y1-1` becomes 0. `prefix_sum[0][x2]` will be 0, which is correct because there's no area above row 1.
    *   As the code iterates through the input grid, if it sees a tree `*`, it treats it as a `1`. If it sees an empty square `.`, it's a `0`.
    *   The `prefix_sum[i][j]` is calculated, storing the total count of trees in the rectangle from `(1,1)` to `(i,j)`.
3.  **Query Processing**:
    *   When a query `(y1, x1, y2, x2)` comes in, the code uses the precomputed `prefix_sum` array to find the answer instantly.
    *   The inclusion-exclusion formula perfectly isolates the number of trees within the desired rectangle `(y1, x1)` to `(y2, x2)`.
    *   The result is printed, and the loop continues to the next query.

This approach is highly efficient and a standard technique for solving this type of problem in competitive programming.
