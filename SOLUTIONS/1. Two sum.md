Leetcode two sum is one of the most first problem you encounter when starting your problem solving journey 
Problem statement 
given an array of size n nums= [1,2,3,4,5]
and a target variable k 
you have to pick any two indexes whose sum is equal to this target variable 


# intuition 
lets iterate through nums and pick an i index for every i check if there is a j such that i+j = k
time complexity =0(n^2)

code 
```python
s=[]
for i in range(0,len(nums)):
	for j in range(i,len(nums)):
		if(nums[i]+nums[j]==k):
			s.append([i,j])
```
problems 
	time , takes too much time 

## approach 2
using a HashMap
