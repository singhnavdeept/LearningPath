There is an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with **distinct** values).
#BinarySearch #Array 
Prior to being passed to your function, `nums` is **possibly rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`1 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `3` and become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the possible rotation and an integer `target`, return _the index of_ `target` _if it is in_ `nums`_, or_ `-1` _if it is not in_ `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
**Output:** 4

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
**Output:** -1

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1], target = 0
**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- All values of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is an ascending array that is possibly rotated.
- `-104 <= target <= 104`

# Rotated binary search 
We will be finding a pivot from where the next element are in ascending order 
let just say we find it and , from the moment after that we will have two array both in sorted ways 
start to that point and that point to end 
```Java
public int findpivot(int arr[] ){
	int l=0;
	int r=arr.length-1;
	while(l<=r){
		int mid=s+(e-s)/2;
		if(int[mid]>int)
	}
}
```

Of course. LeetCode 33: Search in Rotated Sorted Array is a quintessential interview problem that tests your mastery of binary search beyond the basics.

Let's break it down using your detailed structure, with Java for the code examples.

---

### 1. 🔍 **Problem Understanding**

**Simplified Problem Statement:**
You are given an array of unique integers that was originally sorted in ascending order, but has been **rotated** at some unknown pivot point. For example, `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` might become `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`. Your task is to search for a given `target` value in this rotated array. If the target is found, you must return its index; otherwise, return -1.

**The Crucial Constraint:** You must write an algorithm with **O(log n)** time complexity. This is a massive hint that a simple linear scan is not the intended solution.

**Examples:**
*   **Input:** `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `target = 0`
*   **Logic:** The target `0` is present in the array at index 4.
*   **Output:** `4`

*   **Input:** `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `target = 3`
*   **Logic:** The target `3` is not in the array.
*   **Output:** `-1`

*   **Input:** `nums = [1]`, `target = 0`
*   **Logic:** The target `0` is not in the array.
*   **Output:** `-1`

**Edge Cases & Constraints:**
*   **No Rotation:** The array might be rotated 0 times, meaning it's just a regular sorted array (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`). Your algorithm must handle this case.
*   **Small Arrays:** The array could have one or two elements.
*   **Target at Pivot:** The target could be the pivot element itself or an element adjacent to it.
*   **Unique Values:** The problem states all values in `nums` are unique. This simplifies the logic, as we don't need to handle duplicates (that's a follow-up problem, LeetCode 81).

### 2. 🧠 **Intuition Building**

The simplest, most direct way to solve this, if we ignore the O(log n) constraint, is to just look at every element.
1.  Start at the beginning of the array, `index = 0`.
2.  Check if `nums[0]` is the `target`.
3.  If not, move to `index = 1` and check `nums[1]`.
4.  Continue this process until you either find the target and return its index, or you reach the end of the array and return -1.

This is a linear scan. It's guaranteed to be correct, but it's slow and completely ignores the valuable information that the array is "piecewise sorted". This forms our brute-force baseline.

### 3. ⚒️ **Brute Force Implementation**

This implementation follows the linear scan intuition. It's correct but does not meet the performance requirements of the problem.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int search_brute_force(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == target) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}
```

**Why it works:** It exhaustively checks every element, so it cannot miss the target if it exists.

**Where it fails (Complexity):**
*   **Time Complexity: O(N)**. In the worst case (target is the last element or not present), we have to iterate through the entire array. This fails the O(log n) requirement.
*   **Space Complexity: O(1)**. We use no extra space proportional to the input size.

### 4. 🧪 **Pattern Recognition**

*   **What known pattern applies here?** The **O(log n)** time complexity requirement on a sorted (or partially sorted) array is a giant, flashing neon sign pointing directly to **Binary Search**.

*   **Why is a standard binary search not enough?**
    A standard binary search works because we can make a definitive decision at each step. If `nums[mid] < target`, we know the target *must* be in the right half. But in a rotated array, this isn't always true.
    *   Consider `nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `target = 0`.
    *   `left=0`, `right=6`, `mid=3` (`nums[mid] = 7`).
    *   Here, `nums[mid] > target`. In a normal array, we would search left. But here, the target `0` is on the right side of `mid`. The simple rule is broken.

*   **Highlighting the Underlying Concept: Finding the Sorted Half**
    The key insight for this problem is that when we pick a `mid` point, it divides the array into two subarrays. **At least one of these two subarrays will always be perfectly sorted.**
    *   `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`, `mid` is at `7`. The left part `[4, 5, 6, 7]` is sorted. The right part `[0, 1, 2]` is also sorted, but the "break" is between them.
    *   `[7, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6]`, `mid` is at `2`. The right part `[2, 4, 5, 6]` is sorted. The left part `[7, 0, 1]` is the rotated part.

    We can identify the sorted half by comparing `nums[mid]` with the boundary element, `nums[left]`.
    *   If `nums[left] <= nums[mid]`, it means the left half (from `left` to `mid`) is sorted.
    *   If `nums[left] > nums[mid]`, it means the rotation point is in the left half, which implies the **right half** (from `mid` to `right`) must be sorted.

    This insight allows us to adapt binary search. At each step, we identify the sorted half and check if our target could possibly lie within it.

### 5. ⚡ **Optimal Solution (Code + Logic)**

This is the one-pass, modified binary search.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        // 1. Handle edge cases
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        // 2. Initialize pointers for binary search
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        // 3. Standard binary search loop condition
        while (left <= right) {
            // Prevent potential integer overflow, good practice
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            // 4. Quick win: check if we found the target
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }

            // 5. The core logic: Determine which half is sorted
            // Case 1: The left half [left...mid] is sorted
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                // 6. Check if the target is within the bounds of the sorted left half
                if (target >= nums[left] && target < nums[mid]) {
                    // If yes, search in the left half
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    // If no, the target must be in the unsorted right half
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } 
            // Case 2: The right half [mid...right] must be sorted
            else {
                // 7. Check if the target is within the bounds of the sorted right half
                if (target > nums[mid] && target <= nums[right]) {
                    // If yes, search in the right half
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    // If no, the target must be in the unsorted left half
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        // 8. If the loop finishes, the target was not found
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### 6. ⏱️ **Time and Space Complexity**

*   **Brute-Force Approach:**
    *   **Time:** O(N)
    *   **Space:** O(1)

*   **Optimal (Modified Binary Search) Approach:**
    *   **Time:** **O(log N)**. In each iteration of the `while` loop, we discard half of the remaining search space. This is the hallmark of a logarithmic time algorithm.
    *   **Space:** **O(1)**. We only use a few integer pointers (`left`, `right`, `mid`), so the space is constant.

### 7. 🧠 **Design Thought**

*   **Reusable Utility:** This algorithm is a perfect candidate for a static utility method in a `SearchUtils` or `ArrayUtils` class. `public static int searchRotated(int[] data, int target)`.
*   **API Robustness:** A production-grade function would include checks for null input (`if (nums == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(...)`).
*   **Handling Duplicates (Extensibility):** The most common follow-up is "what if the array contains duplicates?" (LeetCode 81). The current logic `if (nums[left] <= nums[mid])` can fail if `nums[left] == nums[mid] == nums[right]`. In that case, you can't determine the sorted half. The safe move is to shrink the search space by one from both ends (`left++; right--;`) and re-evaluate. Mentioning this shows you are thinking ahead about more complex requirements.

### 8. 💥 **Common Mistakes and Gotchas**

1.  **Trying to find the pivot first:** A common alternative is a two-step process: (1) use binary search to find the index of the minimum element (the pivot), then (2) perform a standard binary search on the correct of the two resulting sorted subarrays. While this works, it's more code and effectively two separate O(log N) passes. The single-pass solution is more elegant and efficient.
2.  **Incorrectly checking the target's range:** A very common bug is getting the boundary conditions wrong, especially the equality checks. For example, writing `target > nums[left]` instead of `target >= nums[left]`. You must be precise about whether the `target` can be equal to the boundary elements.
3.  **Off-by-one errors:** Incorrectly updating pointers, e.g., `right = mid` instead of `right = mid - 1`, can lead to infinite loops. The standard `left = mid + 1` and `right = mid - 1` pattern is crucial.
4.  **Mixing up the logic:** Confusing the conditions for when the left half is sorted versus when the right half is sorted is easy to do under pressure. It's vital to write down the two main `if/else` blocks and their nested conditions clearly.

### 9. 📘 **DSA Takeaway**

*   **Primary Pattern:** **Modified Binary Search**. This problem is the canonical example of adapting binary search to a data structure that is not perfectly sorted but still has a strong, exploitable structure.
*   **Core Concept:** **Divide and Conquer by finding a "sane" subproblem.** The key is not to give up on binary search when the standard rules fail. Instead, look for a way to use the `mid` point to identify a part of the array that *does* follow the rules (the sorted half), allowing you to make a definitive decision to eliminate half the search space.
